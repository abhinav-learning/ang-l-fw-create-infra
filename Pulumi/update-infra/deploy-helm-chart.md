To achieve the functionality of generating Helm charts from Kubernetes manifests, tagging them with the git-sha of the commit, publishing to an Amazon ECR repository, and deploying to a Kubernetes cluster after a merge to the main branch, you'd need a combination of CI/CD tools, scripts, and Pulumi code. Pulumi alone may not handle the entire workflow as it is an infrastructure as code tool, not a CI/CD pipeline tool.

Below is a conceptual Pulumi TypeScript program that outlines how you would use Pulumi within this workflow. This program assumes that the CI/CD pipeline has handled the generation of Helm charts, tagging, and committing to ECR, and focuses on how Pulumi can be used to read the kubeconfig from AWS Secrets Manager and deploy the Helm chart to a Kubernetes cluster.

The above program is conceptual and needs to be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline that handles the pre-steps of generating and tagging Helm charts, along with committing to an Amazon ECR repository.

Integrating this process into a CI/CD flow typically involves:

Writing scripts that handle the generation of Helm charts from manifests.
Using Git hooks or webhooks to trigger a CI/CD pipeline upon a merge to the main branch.
Building a CI/CD pipeline using
